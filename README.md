**Expynent** is a tiny library that provides regular expression patterns. This can be useful if you don't want to write regular expression manually. Also you can use this library as [fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html) for testing framework like a [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

## Docs

This is a really tiny library and here no need for the [documentation](http://expynent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Just import pattern and use it! May the force be with you. 


## Installation
```zsh
➜  ~ git clone https://github.com/lk-geimfari/expynent.git
➜  ~ cd expynent/
➜  ~ python setup.py install

```
or
```zsh
➜  ~  pip install expynent
```


## Usage
Just import the pattern that you want:
```python
import re
import expynent.patterns as expas

if re.match(expas.ZIP_CODE['RU'], '43134'):
    print('match')
else:
    print('not match')
    
# Output: 'not match'

```
also you can use compiled patterns:
```python
from expynent.compiled import URL

url = 'http://foo.com/blah_blah_(wikipedia)_(again)'

if URL.match(url):
    print('valid')
else:
    print('invalid')
    
# Output: 'valid'
```

Your contributions are always welcome! Please take a look at the [contribution](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/expynent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines first.

## Attention
This is an **experimental** project and it's mean that we do not guarantee stability. We try to write tests for
all expressions, but we cannot guarantee the perfect operation of regular expressions because it is impossible to cover all cases.
